Knapp",2023,"Short-term Incentives of Research Evaluations: Evidence from the UK Research Excellence Framework",Research Policy,open access,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3083692,,,"We document incentive effects of the evaluation deadlines in the UK’s performance-based research funding system. Studying 3,597,272 publications by UK researchers, we find that publications just before assessment deadlines obtain substantially fewer citations and are published in venues with lower impact factors. These trends reverse abruptly after the deadlines. We discuss different factors that contribute to this observation and provide evidence that evaluation deadlines are likely to set incentives against investment in research quality and long-term topics. We conclude that where such shifts in research incentives are not intended, they might require balancing by additional incentives for exploratory, long-term oriented research.","I wrote the software to match databases and aggregate observables, helped to interpret the findings and contributed to the writing of the article."
"Bös, G. E.",2024,"A Logical Challenge to Correlationism: The Church-Fitch Paradox in Husserl's Account of Fulfilment, Truth, and Meaning",Synthese,open access,"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-024-04584-1",,"This article argues that a logical paradox constrains how we can understand Husserl's semantics and notion of truth.","Husserl’s theory of fulfilment conceives of empty acts, such as symbolic thought, and fulfilling acts, such as sensory perceptions, in a strict parallel. This parallelism is the basis for Husserl’s semantics, epistemology, and conception of truth. It also entails that any true proposition can be known in principle, which Church and Fitch have shown to explode into the claim that every proposition is actually known. I assess this logical challenge and discuss a recent response by James Kinkaid. While Kinkaid’s proposal saves one direction of the parallel for semantics, it gives up the parallelism for truth. I spell out a different response which meshes naturally with Husserl’s account of meaning. If the parallelism is restricted to a class of basic propositions, the truth of non-basic propositions can be defined inductively, without leading to the paradox. I then discuss objections that have been raised against a similar proposal by Dummett. The result is that exegetically plausible and popular interpretations of Husserl’s correlationism lead to logical paradoxes. But when taking into account the ‘logical adumbration’ of propositional blindspots, truth and possible fulfilment can be connected without paradox.",

"Bös, G. E.",forthcoming,"Real Possibilities for Husserl's Correlation between Truth and Evidence",Ergo,preprint,"https://philpapers.org/rec/BSRPFX",,"Already before endorsing transcendental idealism, Husserl pairs truths and possibilities of evidence. This ‘correlationism’ is central for phenomenological metaphysics, but it remains disputed how it determines truth and evidence, including whether it gives a form of priority to either notion. I approach these questions by focusing on the employed notion of possibility and its changes between Husserl’s early and later work. While originally formulating correlationism in terms of ideal possibilities, Husserl realizes that this cannot be extended to account for contingent truths. He then discusses the correlation principle in terms of those ideal possibilities that are motivated. But this faces simple objections: 1.) possibilities can be motivated by false beliefs, and 2.) we can be contingently ignorant about possibilities of evidence. The problem is that the shift from ideal to motivated possibility replaces an alethic with an epistemic notion of possibility. One may in response try to characterize real possibilities in terms of the contingent truths of the actual world, but then the characterization of truth in terms of real possibilities becomes circular. A more promising alternative is to replace the noetic factor ‘motivation’ with a noematic factor ‘potentiality’. On this reading, the correlationist thesis asserts that any obtaining state of affairs has a potentiality for recognition in evident judgement.",
