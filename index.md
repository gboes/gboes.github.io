# Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the philosophy department of KU Leuven, member of the Centre of Philosophy of Science and the Husserl Archives.
I have completed my [PhD](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/founding-science-on-the-lifeworld(405e0ffa-8c83-4ceb-bb04-dbc655b52a42).html "PhD at KCL repository")  in philosophy at King's College London in 2022, and before that obtained degrees in philosophy and physics from LMU Munich.

<!-- Did you ever wonder what the world of your great-grandparents looked like &mdash; to them, not you? Changes in politics and religious beliefs might make for the most dramatic differences, but there are also differences in how we conceive of the natural world.  -->
<!-- I am trying to understand how scientific theories (should) affect the concepts which operate in everyday life.  -->

My philosophical interests are wide, but they revolve around the relation between the conceptual maps we develop in empirical sciences and the world as it presents itself in everyday experience. This means that I am developing phenomenological philosophy in the domain of general philosophy of science and more specifically the scientific realism debate.
This involves debates with a long history, and the choices of which parts of that literature is still being read can be quite arbitrary. 
Another strand in my work is therefore to leverage computational methods for the study of the history of philosophy (of science). 
This was in particular developed in [Sander Verhaegh](http://www.sanderverhaegh.nl/)'s ERC project [Exiled Empiricists](https://exiledempiricists.wordpress.com/), which led to an 
<a href="https://edhiphy.org">interactive web-application</a>. 
I previously worked as a data scientist and contributed to empirical research on the UK Research Evaluation Framework (with Moqi Groen-Xu, [Research Policy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2023.104729) ). 

Besides my academic profile, this website also has a small section for [tools](./tools/) that describes tools which found useful for philosophy research.


<!-- The second is to leverage new computational methods for the history of philosophy.  -->

<!-- My PhD thesis focused on the phenomenological notion of *lifeworld* and how to conceive of it in the philosophy of science. This led me to questions ranging from logic, metaphysics, and semantics to the history of philosophy in the 19th and 20th century. This is one of the projects that aim to navigate between what Sellars has called the manifest and scientific image of the world. I plan to extend the phenomenological discussion of the mathematization of nature into the 21st century, where new conceptual changes are driven by digitalization.  -->
